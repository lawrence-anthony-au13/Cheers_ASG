Movie Cards Project

A basic application that displays a list of movies as a list of cards. Each card provides movie detail such as title, subtitle, description, image, and rating. The application is composed of the following components:

1. Header - A heading that displays application title
2. Movies - The primary (root) component that manages state for Movies and all underlying components. It is also responsible for connecting to MovieService to retrieve movie data
3. MovieList - Groups a collection of movies
4. MovieCard - Represents a single instance of a movie
